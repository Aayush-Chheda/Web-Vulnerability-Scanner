## Features & Functionalities Implemented - 

### 1. SQL Injection Scanner - A Python script which will help detect SQL Injection vulnerability in web applicatons.

**Working** - This program checks for the vulnerability in the URL first, this is done by appending a single or double quote character to the URL. After that, we parse the forms and make submissions with quote characters on each form found in the webpage. We then check the response for certain errors to determine whether the web application is vulnerable or not.

### 2. XSS Vulnerability Scanner - This Python script will help detect Cross-site scripting vulnerability in webpages.

**Working** - XSS vulnerabilites are exploited in forms present on websites, so the idea is to fill out forms using javascript code. First, we get all the forms from the HTML content of any webpage, after that we fill out those forms with some javascript code and submit them. If the code is successfully executed then we conclude that the website is XSS vulnerable.

### 3. Subdomain Scanner - A Python program which fill find subdomains of a particular website and help explore its full domain infrastructure.

**Working** - To search for different subdomains we use the brute force method i.e. we test for all common subdomain names of that particular domain and if we receive a response from the server, that subdomain is working and functional.
